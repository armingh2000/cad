   to a specific location and/or has an undefined I/O Standard (IOSTANDARD).
   This condition may seriously affect the device and will be an error in
   bitstream creation. It should be corrected by properly specifying the pin
   location and I/O Standard.

  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           32
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            32 out of      32  100%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      32    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
